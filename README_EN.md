## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this dilemma: a presentation is due tomorrow, but your PPT is still a blank slate? You have countless brilliant ideas, yet all your passion is drained by tedious layout and design work.

We long to create professional and well-designed presentations quickly. Traditional AI PPT generation apps, while generally satisfying the need for "speed," still face the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Only preset templates can be selected, with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low flexibility, making multiple rounds of revisions difficult.
- 3️⃣ The final results look similar, with severe homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Lower quality materials that lack specificity.
- 5️⃣ Disconnected text-image layouts and poor design sense.

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously meet our two major needs for PPT production: "speed" and "aesthetics." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPTs" are, in my eyes, far from having enough "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana 🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌 pro for PPT page generation and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. Moreover, it can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompts and strictly follow the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌 pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Beginners**: Generate aesthetic PPTs quickly with zero barrier to entry and no design experience, reducing the hassle of template selection.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Gain design inspiration quickly by referencing AI-generated layouts and combinations of graphics and text.
3. **Educators**: Swiftly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to improve classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete assignment presentations, focusing effort on content rather than layout and aesthetics.
5. **Professionals**: Rapidly visualize business proposals and product introductions with easy adaptation to multiple scenarios.

## 🎯 Features

### 1. Flexible and Diverse Creative Paths

Supports three starting methods—**Ideas**, **Outlines**, and **Page Descriptions**—to accommodate different creative habits.
- **One-sentence generation**: Enter a topic, and the AI automatically generates a structured outline and page-by-page content descriptions.
- **Natural language editing**: Supports modifying outlines or descriptions using "Vibe" prompts (e.g., "Change the third page to a case study"), with the AI adjusting in real-time.
- **Outline/Description mode**: Supports both one-click batch generation and manual detail adjustment.

  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (For GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models through GCP service accounts, and new users can use free credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the JSON format key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set the following in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml`, mount the key file into the container, and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`.

</details>

2. **Start Service**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> In case of network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file and then rerun the startup command:

### Deploying from source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required for the "PPT Refurbishment" feature when uploading PPTX files, used to convert PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading**. Reason: LibreOffice may cause layout misalignment during server-side rendering due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore certain special effects. LibreOffice is not required when uploading PDF files. Docker users who still need PPTX upload support within the container can run:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost after the container is rebuilt and must be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run the following command in the project root directory:
```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure environment variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and configure your API keys:
> **The large model interfaces in this project follow the AIHubMix platform format. It is recommended to use [AIHubMix](https://aihubmix.com/?aff=17EC) to obtain API keys to minimize migration costs.** 
```env

# AI Provider Configuration Format (gemini / openai / vertex)

# Gemini Format Configuration (Used when AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=gemini)

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
GOOGLE_API_BASE=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com

# Proxy Example: https://aihubmix.com/gemini

# OpenAI Format Configuration (Used when AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=openai)

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1

# Proxy Example: https://aihubmix.com/v1

# Vertex AI Configuration (AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex)

# Requires GCP Project and Service Account Key

# VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id

# VERTEX_LOCATION=global

# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./gcp-service-account.json

> (Optional) If you have important local data, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

Visit `http://localhost:5000/health` to verify if the service is running correctly.

## **🔧 FAQ**

1. **Garbled or blurry text on generated pages**
    - You can choose a higher output resolution (the OpenAI format may not support resolution adjustment; using the Gemini format is recommended). Based on testing, adjusting the resolution from 1k to 2k before generating the page significantly improves text rendering quality.
    - Ensure that the specific text content to be rendered is included in the page description.

2. **Poor results when exporting editable PPT, such as overlapping text or missing styles**
    - In 90% of cases, this is due to API configuration issues. Please refer to the troubleshooting and solutions in [issue 121](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121).

3. **Is the Gemini API Key free tier supported?**
    - The free tier only supports text generation and does not support image generation.

4. **503 error or Retry Error during content generation**
    - You can check the Docker backend logs using the commands in the README to locate the detailed error for the 503 issue. This is usually caused by incorrect model configurations.

5. **Why doesn't the API Key take effect after being set in .env?**
    - Editing `.env` during runtime requires a restart of the Docker container to apply the changes.
    - If parameters were previously configured on the web settings page, they will override the parameters in `.env`. You can restore the `.env` settings by clicking "Restore Default Settings".
