## ✨ Project Origins

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: the presentation is due tomorrow, but the slides are still blank; your head is filled with brilliant ideas, but your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and aesthetically pleasing. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still suffer from the following problems:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates, with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making iterative revisions difficult.
- 3️⃣ Similar visual output, suffering from severe homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack relevance.
- 5️⃣ Disjointed text and image layouts with a poor sense of design.

These shortcomings make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously meet our two core requirements: "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPTs" are far from being truly "Vibe" in my eyes.

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I experimented with 🍌pro for PPT slide generation and found that the results were excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. Moreover, it can accurately render almost all the text specified in the prompt while strictly following the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Beginners**: Generate beautiful PPTs quickly with zero barrier and no design experience, reducing the hassle of selecting templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Gain design inspiration quickly by referencing AI-generated layouts and image-text combinations.
3. **Educators**: Rapidly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plans to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Complete assignment presentations quickly, focusing on content rather than formatting and aesthetics.
5. **Professionals**: Rapidly visualize business proposals and product introductions with quick adaptation for various scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, enabling everyone to quickly create beautiful and professional presentations.</b>

**Use the new editable export configuration method to achieve better editable export results**: You need to obtain an API KEY from the [Baidu AI Cloud Platform](https://console.bce.baidu.com/iam/#/iam/apikey/list) (click here to enter) and fill it in the `BAIDU_API_KEY` field in the `.env` file (there is a sufficient free usage quota). See instructions in https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121 for details.


<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (for GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models via GCP service accounts; new users can use the free credit. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the JSON key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set the following in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If using Docker deployment, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml` to mount the key file into the container and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`.

</details>

2. **Start Service**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest main branch version). You can skip the local build steps to achieve rapid deployment:

```bash

# Start Using Pre-built Images (No need to build from scratch)

docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

After starting, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application. The application will determine if updates are available based on the current version SHA; the current Git SHA will also be used for comparison when running from source.

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file and then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following lines in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```


3. **Access the Application**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3011
- Backend API: http://localhost:5011

4. **View Logs**

```bash
```

# View Backend Logs (Last 200 Lines)

docker logs --tail 200 banana-slides-backend

# View Backend Logs in Real-time (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs -f --tail 100 banana-slides-backend

# View Frontend Logs (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs --tail 100 banana-slides-frontend
```

5. **Stop Services**

```bash
docker compose down
```

6. **Update Project**

**Using Pre-built Images (docker-compose.prod.yml)**

Alternatively, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the app to see if a new version is available.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Using Local Build (docker-compose.yml)**

Note: If you have manually modified the code, this method is not applicable; you need to revert the code to the version from the last pull first.

```bash
git pull 
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Deploy from Source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for narrated video export; must include support for `libass` / `ass` subtitle filters
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when uploading PPTX files using the "PPT Refurbishment" feature, used to convert PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading.** Reason: Server-side rendering with LibreOffice may result in layout issues due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully reproduce certain special effects. LibreOffice is not required if uploading PDF files. Docker users who still need to support PPTX uploads within the container can execute:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost after the container is rebuilt and will need to be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the code repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run the following in the project root directory:
```bash

# macOS (Homebrew)

brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full

# Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9

# Then Install Python Dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

# Then, following the aforementioned method, open and edit the `.env` file to configure your API key

```markdown

```

#### Front-end Installation

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure API address**

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service specified by `BACKEND_PORT` (default `http://localhost:5011`) via Vite proxy. To modify this, please set `BACKEND_PORT` in the `.env` file in the project root.

#### Start Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important local data, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`
> Note: Under the default configuration, templates, assets, and finished products are all stored in the `uploads/` folder.

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5011`.

Visit `http://localhost:5011/health` to verify if the service is running correctly.

#### Start Frontend Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3011`.

Open your browser to access and use the application.
