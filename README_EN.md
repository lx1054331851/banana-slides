## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: you have a presentation due tomorrow, but your PPT is still a blank slate; you have countless brilliant ideas in your head, yet all your passion is drained by tedious layout and design work?

I (we) long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Only preset templates can be selected, with no flexibility to adjust styles
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making it difficult to perform multiple rounds of revisions
- 3️⃣ Finished products look similar, with severe homogenization
- 4️⃣ Low material quality and lack of specificity
- 5️⃣ Disjointed text and image layout with a poor sense of design

These shortcomings make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our dual needs for "speed" and "aesthetics." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" fall far short of being truly "Vibe" in my eyes.

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro for PPT page generation and found that the results were excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompts and follow the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate aesthetic PPTs with zero threshold and no design experience, reducing the hassle of template selection.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Quickly gain design inspiration by referencing AI-generated layouts and combinations of graphic and text elements.
3. **Educators**: Rapidly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to improve classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete assignment presentations, focusing effort on content rather than formatting and beautification.
5. **Workplace Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions, with fast adaptation to multiple scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (For GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models through GCP service accounts. New users can use their free credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the JSON key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set the following in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml` to mount the key file into the container and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`

</details>

2. **Start Service**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip local build steps for rapid deployment:

```bash

# Start with Pre-built Images (No Need to Build from Scratch)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file, then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/

### Deploy from source

#### Environmental Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when uploading PPTX files using the "PPT Refurbish" feature to convert PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading.** Reason: Server-side rendering by LibreOffice may result in layout issues due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and may not fully replicate certain special effects. LibreOffice is not required if you upload PDF files. Docker users who still need PPTX upload support within the container can run:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost after the container is rebuilt and will need to be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

Run the following command in the project root directory:
```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and configure your API key:
> **The LLM interfaces in this project follow the AIHubMix platform format. It is recommended to use [AIHubMix](https://aihubmix.com/?aff=17EC) to obtain an API key to reduce migration costs.** 
```env

# AI Provider Configuration Format (gemini / openai / vertex)

AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=gemini

# Gemini Format Configuration (Used when AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=gemini)

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
GOOGLE_API_BASE=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com

# Proxy Example: https://aihubmix.com/gemini

# OpenAI Format Configuration (Used when AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=openai)

OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1

# Proxy Example: https://aihubmix.com/v1

# Vertex AI Configuration (AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex)

# Requires GCP Project and Service Account Key

# VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id

# VERTEX_LOCATION=global

# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./gcp-service-account.json

# Modify this variable to control the backend service port

BACKEND_PORT=5000
...
```

#### Frontend Installation

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service at `http://localhost:5000`. To modify this, please edit `src/api/client.ts`.

#### Start Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important local data, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

Visit `http://localhost:5000/health` to verify that the service is running correctly.

## **🔧 FAQ**

1. **Generated page text has garbled characters or is unclear**
    - You can choose a higher output resolution (the OpenAI format may not support increasing the resolution; using the Gemini format is recommended). Based on testing, increasing the resolution from 1k to 2k before generating the page will significantly improve text rendering quality.
    - Please ensure that the specific text content to be rendered is included in the page description.

2. **Poor results when exporting editable PPT, such as overlapping text, missing styles, etc.**
    - In 90% of cases, this is due to API configuration issues. Please refer to [issue 121](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121) for troubleshooting and solutions.

3. **Is the free tier Gemini API Key supported?**
    - The free tier only supports text generation and does not support image generation.

4. **503 error or Retry Error prompted during content generation**
    - You can check the Docker backend logs using the commands in the README to locate the detailed error message for the 503 issue. This is usually caused by incorrect model configuration.

5. **Why does the API Key set in .env not take effect?**
    - After editing `.env` during runtime, you must restart the Docker container to apply the changes.
    - If parameters were previously configured on the web settings page, they will override the parameters in `.env`. You can revert to the `.env` settings by selecting "Restore Default Settings".
