## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: the presentation is tomorrow, yet the slides are still blank; your head is filled with countless brilliant ideas, but all your passion is drained by the tediousness of layout and design?

I (we) long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and aesthetically pleasing. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the demand for "speed," they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates, with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult.
- 3️⃣ Similar-looking outputs with severe homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Low-quality materials that lack relevance.
- 5️⃣ Disjointed text and graphic layout, resulting in a poor sense of design.

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our two core needs: "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, far from having enough "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has turned things around. I tried using 🍌pro for PPT page generation and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompts while strictly following the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Generate beautiful PPTs with zero threshold and no design experience, reducing the hassle of selecting templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Reference AI-generated layouts and combinations of graphics and text to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Rapidly convert teaching content into illustrated PPT lesson plans to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Complete presentation assignments quickly, focusing energy on content rather than layout and beautification.
5. **Business Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions, with rapid adaptation for multiple scenarios.

  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (for GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models through a GCP service account, and new users can use trial credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account and download the JSON format key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set the following in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml`, mount the key file into the container, and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`

## **🔧 FAQ**

1. **Garbled or blurry text on generated pages**
    - Select a higher resolution output (the OpenAI format may not support resolution adjustments; using the Gemini format is recommended). According to tests, increasing the resolution from 1k to 2k before generating the page significantly improves text rendering quality.
    - Please ensure that the specific text content to be rendered is included in the page description.

2. **Poor results when exporting editable PPT, such as overlapping text or missing styles**
    - In 90% of cases, this is caused by API configuration issues. Please refer to the troubleshooting and solutions in [issue 121](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121).

3. **Is the free tier Gemini API Key supported?**
    - The free tier only supports text generation and does not support image generation.

4. **503 Error or Retry Error when generating content**
    - You can check the Docker backend logs using the commands provided in the README to locate the detailed error message for the 503 issue. This is generally caused by incorrect model configuration.

5. **Why doesn't the API Key take effect after setting it in .env?**
    - After editing the `.env` file during runtime, you must restart the Docker container to apply the changes.
    - If you have previously configured parameters in the web settings page, they will override the parameters in the `.env` file. You can revert to the `.env` settings by selecting "Restore Default Settings."
