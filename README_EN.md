## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: the presentation is due tomorrow, but the slides are still blank; you have countless brilliant ideas, but your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and aesthetically pleasing. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates, with no flexibility to adjust styles
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult 
- 3️⃣ Finished products look strikingly similar, with severe homogenization
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack specificity
- 5️⃣ Fragmented image-text layouts with a poor sense of design

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our dual needs for "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, still far from having enough "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the **nano banana🍌** model has changed everything. I tried using **🍌pro** for slide generation and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompt and faithfully follows the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on **🍌pro**?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Generate beautiful PPTs instantly with zero barriers and no design experience, reducing the hassle of selecting templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Reference AI-generated layouts and element combinations to quickly find design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Rapidly transform teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Complete presentation assignments quickly, focusing effort on content rather than formatting and styling.
5. **Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions with fast adaptation for various scenarios.

## **🔧 Frequently Asked Questions**

1. **Garbled or blurry text on generated pages**
    - You can choose a higher output resolution (OpenAI format may not support increasing resolution; Gemini format is recommended). According to tests, increasing the resolution from 1k to 2k before generating the page significantly improves text rendering quality.
    - Please ensure that the page description includes the specific text content you want to render.

2. **Poor results when exporting editable PPT, such as overlapping text or missing styles**
    - In 90% of cases, this is due to an API configuration issue. Please refer to the troubleshooting and solutions in [issue 121](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121).

3. **Does it support free-tier Gemini API Keys?**
    - The free tier only supports text generation and does not support image generation.

4. **Receiving a 503 error or Retry Error when generating content**
    - You can check the Docker backend logs using the commands in the README to locate the detailed error for the 503 issue. This is usually caused by incorrect model configuration.

5. **Why doesn't the API Key take effect after setting it in the .env file?**
    - After editing the `.env` file during runtime, you need to restart the Docker container to apply the changes.
    - If you have previously configured parameters in the web settings page, they will override the `.env` parameters. You can restore the `.env` settings by selecting "Restore Default Settings."
