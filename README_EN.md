## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: your presentation is due tomorrow, but the slides are still blank; you have countless brilliant ideas in your head, but your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design?

We long for the ability to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps largely satisfy the "speed" requirement, they still face the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Only preset templates can be selected, with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult.
- 3️⃣ Finished products look similar, with severe homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Low asset quality and a lack of specific relevance.
- 5️⃣ Disjointed image-text layouts and poor design sense.

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our two major needs: "speed" and "aesthetics." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my view, far from truly having that "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro for PPT slide generation and found that the results were excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompts and strictly follows the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Beginners**: Generate beautiful PPTs with zero barriers and no design experience, eliminating the hassle of choosing templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Use AI-generated layouts and element combinations as a reference to quickly spark design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Rapidly convert teaching materials into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom engagement.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete presentation assignments, focusing efforts on content rather than formatting and aesthetics.
5. **Professionals**: Rapidly visualize business proposals and product introductions with quick adaptation for various scenarios.

## 🎯 Features

### 1. Flexible and Diverse Creative Paths

Supports three starting methods: **Idea**, **Outline**, and **Page Description**, catering to different creative habits.
- **One-sentence Generation**: Enter a topic, and AI automatically generates a well-structured outline and page-by-page content descriptions.
- **Natural Language Editing**: Supports modifying outlines or descriptions via conversational "Vibe" prompts (e.g., "Change the third page to a case study"), with AI adjusting in real-time.
- **Outline/Description Mode**: Supports both one-click batch generation and manual fine-tuning of details.

### Using Docker Compose 🐳 (Recommended)

This is the simplest deployment method, allowing you to start both front-end and back-end services with one click.

<details>
  <summary>📒Instructions for Windows Users</summary>

If you are using Windows, please install Windows Docker Desktop first. Check the Docker icon in the system tray to ensure Docker is running, then follow the same steps.

> **Tip**: If you encounter issues, ensure that the WSL 2 backend is enabled in the Docker Desktop settings (recommended), and make sure ports 3000 and 5000 are not occupied.

</details>

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides

1. **Configure environment variables**

Create the `.env` file (refer to `.env.example`):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and configure the necessary environment variables:
> **The LLM API in this project follows the AIHubMix platform format. It is recommended to use [AIHubMix](https://aihubmix.com/?aff=17EC) to obtain an API key to reduce migration costs.**<br>
> **Friendly Reminder: The API costs for Google Nano and Banana Pro models are relatively high. Please be mindful of usage costs.**
```env

**Use the new version of editable export configuration to achieve better editable export effects**: You need to obtain an API KEY from the [Baidu Intelligent Cloud Platform](https://console.bce.baidu.com/iam/#/iam/apikey/list) (click here to enter), and fill it in the `BAIDU_OCR_API_KEY` field in the `.env` file (there is a generous free usage quota). See the instructions in https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121 for details.


<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (For GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models via GCP service accounts, and new users can use free credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the JSON format key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment relevant lines in `docker-compose.yml` to mount the key file into the container and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`

</details>

2. **Start the service**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Update: The project also provides pre-built frontend and backend images on DockerHub (synchronized with the latest version of the main branch), named:
1. anoinex/banana-slides-frontend
2. anoinex/banana-slides-backend


> [!TIP]
> In case of network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file and then run the startup command again:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources (Mainland China)
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com

cd minimal-backend
```

### 2. Environment Preparation

Using a virtual environment is recommended:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py

**FAQ**
1.  **Is the free tier Gemini API Key supported?**
    *   The free tier only supports text generation; image generation is not supported.
2.  **Prompted with a 503 error or Retry Error when generating content**
    *   You can view the internal Docker logs using the commands in the README to locate the detailed error for the 503 issue. This is usually caused by incorrect model configuration.
3.  **Why is the API Key not taking effect after setting it in .env?**
    1.  Editing `.env` at runtime requires restarting the Docker container to apply changes.
    2.  If you have previously configured settings on the web settings page, they will override the parameters in `.env`. You can revert to the `.env` settings by using "Restore Default Settings."
4.  **Garbled text appears in the generated page**
    *   Try higher resolution output (the OpenAI format may not support increasing the resolution).
    *   Ensure that the specific text content to be rendered is included in the page description.
