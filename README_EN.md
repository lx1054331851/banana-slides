## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: you have a presentation tomorrow, but your slides are still blank; your head is full of brilliant ideas, yet your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the "speed" requirement, they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Can only choose from preset templates, with no flexibility to adjust styles
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making it difficult to perform multiple rounds of revisions
- 3️⃣ Similar visual output with severe homogenization
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack relevance
- 5️⃣ Fragmented layout of text and images, with poor design quality

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our two major needs: "speed" and "aesthetics." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, far from having enough "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro to generate PPT pages and found that the results were excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can accurately render almost all the text requested in the prompt and follow the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate aesthetically pleasing PPTs with zero barriers; no design experience required, reducing the hassle of selecting templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Rapidly gain design inspiration by referencing AI-generated layouts and combinations of graphics and text.
3. **Educators**: Swiftly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to improve classroom engagement.
4. **Students**: Complete presentation assignments quickly, allowing them to focus on content rather than layout and aesthetics.
5. **Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions with seamless adaptation across various scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (for GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models through a GCP service account, and new users can use free credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the JSON format key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set the following in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If using Docker for deployment, you also need to uncomment relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml` to mount the key file into the container and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`.

</details>

2. **Starting the Service**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip local build steps and achieve rapid deployment:

```bash

# Start with Pre-built Images (No need to build from scratch)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file and then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com

### Deploy from Source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when uploading PPTX files using the "PPT Refurbish" feature, used for converting PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading**. Reason: LibreOffice may cause layout misalignment during server-side rendering due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore some special effects. LibreOffice is not required for uploading PDF files. Docker users who still need PPTX upload support within the container can run:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost after the container is rebuilt and will need to be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run in the project root directory:
```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure environment variables**

## **🔧 Frequently Asked Questions**

1. **Garbled or blurry text on generated pages**
    - You can select a higher output resolution (OpenAI format may not support increasing resolution; Gemini format is recommended). Based on testing, increasing the resolution from 1k to 2k before generating pages significantly improves text rendering quality.
    - Please ensure that the page description includes the specific text content you want to render.

2. **Poor results when exporting editable PPT, such as overlapping text or missing styles**
    - In 90% of cases, this is due to API configuration issues. You can refer to the troubleshooting and solutions in [issue 121](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121).

3. **Does it support the free tier Gemini API Key?**
    - The free tier only supports text generation and does not support image generation.

4. **Receiving 503 error or Retry Error when generating content**
    - You can check the Docker backend logs using the commands in the README to locate the detailed error for the 503 issue. This is usually caused by incorrect model configuration.

5. **Why is the API Key set in .env not taking effect?**
    - You need to restart the Docker container to apply changes after editing `.env` during runtime.
    - If parameters were previously configured on the web settings page, they will override the parameters in `.env`. You can restore the `.env` settings by clicking "Restore Default Settings".
