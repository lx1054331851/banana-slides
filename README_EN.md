## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this dilemma: you have a presentation tomorrow, but your slides are still blank; your head is full of brilliant ideas, but your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still face the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Only preset templates are available, with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult. 
- 3️⃣ Similar visual results with severe homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack specificity.
- 5️⃣ Fragmented image-text layouts with a poor sense of design.

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our two core requirements: "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, still far from having a true "vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana 🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro to generate PPT pages and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It accurately renders almost all text required by the prompts and follows the style of reference images perfectly. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate beautiful PPTs with zero barrier to entry and no design experience required, reducing the hassle of choosing templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Reference AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and graphic elements to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Rapidly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete presentation assignments and focus energy on content rather than formatting and aesthetics.
5. **Professionals**: Rapidly visualize business proposals and product introductions with quick adaptation across multiple scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (for GCP users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows Gemini models to be called via GCP service accounts. New users can use promotional credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the JSON key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set the following in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml`, mount the key file into the container, and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series of models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`

</details>

2. **Start Service**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip local build steps and achieve rapid deployment:

```bash

# Start with Pre-built Images (No Need to Build from Scratch)

docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> In case of network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file and then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com

### Build from source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when using the "PPT Refurbish" feature to upload PPTX files, used to convert PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading**. Reason: LibreOffice may cause layout issues during server-side rendering due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully reproduce some special effects. LibreOffice is not required if you upload PDF files. Docker users who still need PPTX upload support within the container can execute:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost after the container is rebuilt and will need to be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run the following in the project root directory:
```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies according to `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure environment variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and configure your API key:
> **The LLM interface in this project follows the AIHubMix platform format. It is recommended to use [AIHubMix](https://aihubmix.com/?aff=17EC) to obtain an API key to reduce migration costs.** 
```env

# AI Provider Configuration Format (gemini / openai / vertex)

npm install
```

3. **Configure API address**

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service at `http://localhost:5000`. If you need to modify it, please edit `src/api/client.ts`.

#### Start Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important local data, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

Visit `http://localhost:5000/health` to verify if the service is running correctly.

## **🔧 Frequently Asked Questions**

1. **Garbled text or blurry text in generated pages**
    - You can choose a higher resolution output (the OpenAI format may not support increasing resolution; Gemini format is recommended). Testing shows that increasing resolution from 1k to 2k before generation significantly improves text rendering quality.
    - Ensure the page description includes the specific text content you want to render.

2. **Poor results when exporting editable PPT, such as overlapping text or missing styles**
    - In 90% of cases, this is due to API configuration issues. Please refer to [issue 121](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121) for troubleshooting and solutions.

3. **Does it support the free tier Gemini API Key?**
    - The free tier only supports text generation and does not support image generation.

4. **Encountering 503 error or Retry Error when generating content**
    - You can check the Docker backend logs using the commands in the README to locate the detailed error for the 503 issue. It is usually caused by incorrect model configuration.

5. **Why is the API Key set in .env not taking effect?**
    - You need to restart the Docker container after editing `.env` to apply the changes.
    - If you have previously configured parameters on the web settings page, they will override the `.env` settings. You can revert to the `.env` settings by clicking "Restore Default Settings."
