## 🔥 Latest Updates

- **[2026-04-25]**: Asset Toolbox launched — Added three modes: full-image editing, selection editing (overlay/replace), and smart erase to the existing asset generation, providing a unified entry for one-stop operations.
- **[2026-04-25]**: Added support for account binding via official OpenAI OAuth. Once bound, Codex can be used directly as a text/image generation provider without manually entering an API Key. Plus accounts can generate 100+ 2K images every five hours ([Tutorial](https://ziy68cvfvu3.feishu.cn/wiki/LDSOwPzkhiNonkkNTF1ct2VBnNc)) (Based on the official OpenAI OAuth PKCE authorization flow, non-reverse engineered).
- **[2026-04-25]**: Support for saving custom text style description templates. They can be named, color-coded, and reused persistently, eliminating the need for repetitive input.
- **[2026-04-23]**: Added support for the gpt-image-2 model. Exportable editable background effects have also been improved due to model capability upgrades (Select "Generative Retrieval" in Settings -> Export Options -> Background Retrieval).
- **[2026-04-11]**: Added [CLI support and Agent Skills](https://docs.bananaslides.online/cli).
- **[2026-03]**: Added several features and optimizations, such as extra fields and multi-aspect ratio settings.
- **[2026-02-09]**: New Features and Optimizations
  * New Features
    * Paste and instantly identify images on the home page, outline, and description cards, with an improved interaction experience.
    * Manual outline chapter editing: Support for manually adjusting the chapter (part) a page belongs to.

  * Fixes and UX Optimizations
    * Fixed export-related 500 errors, reference file association timing, outline/page data misalignment, task polling errors, infinite polling in description generation, image preview memory leaks, and partial failure handling in batch deletion.
    * Optimized format example prompts, HTTP error message copy, modal closing experience, cleanup of old project localStorage, and removal of redundant prompts for first-time project creation.
    * Various other optimizations and fixes.

## ✨ Project Origins

Have you ever found yourself in this dilemma: you have a presentation tomorrow, but your slides are still blank; your mind is full of brilliant ideas, but your passion is drained by tedious layout and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates with no flexibility to adjust styles
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making it difficult to perform multiple rounds of revisions 
- 3️⃣ Similar visual output with heavy homogenization
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack relevance
- 5️⃣ Disjointed text and image layouts with poor design aesthetics

These flaws make it hard for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our two core requirements: "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, far from being "vibe" enough.

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro to generate PPT pages and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. Furthermore, it can precisely render almost all text requested in the prompts and faithfully follow the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate beautiful PPTs with zero barrier to entry—no design experience required, eliminating the hassle of choosing templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Quickly gain design inspiration by referencing AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and visual elements.
3. **Educators**: Rapidly convert teaching materials into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Complete presentation assignments quickly, allowing focus on content rather than formatting and aesthetics.
5. **Business Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions with fast adaptation across multiple scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯 Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, enabling everyone to quickly produce beautiful and professional presentations.</b>

## 🎯 Features

### 1. Flexible and Diverse Creation Paths

Supports three starting modes: **Ideas**, **Outlines**, and **Page Descriptions**, catering to different creative habits.
- **One-Sentence Generation**: Enter a topic, and the AI automatically generates a well-structured outline and page-by-page content descriptions.
- **Natural Language Editing**: Supports modifying outlines or descriptions via Vibe prompts (e.g., "Change the third page to a case study"), with the AI responding and adjusting in real-time.
- **Outline/Description Mode**: Supports both one-click batch generation and manual fine-tuning of details.

<img width="2000" height="1125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fc1ecc6-433d-4157-b4ca-95fcebac66ba" />

### 2. Powerful Asset Parsing Capability

- **Multi-format Support**: Upload PDF, Docx, MD, Txt, and other file formats, and the system will automatically parse the content in the background.
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Automatically identify key points, image links, and chart information from the text, providing rich materials for generation.
- **Automatic Image Archiving**: Images parsed from documents are automatically added to the project asset library once the reference files are linked to the project, allowing for direct reuse later.
- **Style Reference**: Supports uploading reference images or templates to customize the PPT style.

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="File Parsing and Asset Processing" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cda1fd2-2369-4028-b310-ea6604183936" />

### 3. "Vibe"-style Natural Language Modification

No longer restricted by complex menu buttons, issue modification commands directly through **natural language**.
- **Partial Inpainting**: Perform verbal modifications on unsatisfactory areas (e.g., "change this chart to a pie chart").
- **Full-Page Optimization**: Generate high-definition pages with a consistent style based on nano banana pro🍌.

<img width="2000" height="1125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/929ba24a-996c-4f6d-9ec6-818be6b08ea3" />

### 4. Out-of-the-box Format Export

- **Multi-format Support**: One-click export to standard **PPTX** or **PDF** files.
- **Playback Settings**: Enable slide transition animations before exporting PPTX. Supports classic effects such as Fade, Push, Wipe, Split, Blinds, Checkerboard, Clock, and more, with the option to multi-select for random application.
- **Export File Management**: The preview page lists files already exported on the server, allowing you to directly download or delete files no longer needed. Export task history is isolated by project for clearing, preventing accidental deletion of records from other projects.
- **Perfect Fit**: Default 16:9 aspect ratio; layout requires no secondary adjustments and is ready for immediate presentation.

**Use the new editable export configuration method to get better editable export results**: You need to obtain an API KEY from the [Baidu AI Cloud Platform](https://console.bce.baidu.com/iam/#/iam/apikey/list) (click here to enter), and fill it in the `BAIDU_API_KEY` field in the `.env` file (there is an ample free usage quota). See the instructions in https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121 for details.


<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (for GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models via a GCP service account, and new users can use trial credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the JSON format key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set the following in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml` to mount the key file into the container and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`

</details>

2. **Start Service**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip local build steps for rapid deployment:

```bash

# Start with Pre-built Images (No Build from Scratch Required)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

After startup, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application. The app will determine if there is an update available based on the current version SHA; the current Git SHA will also be used for determination when running from source code.

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file and rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use mirrors in China
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```


3. **Accessing the Application**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3011
- Backend API: http://localhost:5011

4. **Viewing Logs**

```bash
```

# View Backend Logs (Last 200 Lines)

docker logs --tail 200 banana-slides-backend

# View Backend Logs in Real-time (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs -f --tail 100 banana-slides-backend

# View Frontend Logs (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs --tail 100 banana-slides-frontend
```

5. **Stop Services**

```bash
docker compose down
```

6. **Update Project**

**Using pre-built images (docker-compose.prod.yml)**

Alternatively, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application to see if a new version is available.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Using local build (docker-compose.yml)**

Note: If you have manually modified the code, this method is not applicable. You need to revert the code to the pulled version first.

```bash
git pull 
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Deploy from Source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for explanation video export; must include `libass` / `ass` subtitle filter support
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required for converting PPTX to PDF when using the "PPT Revamp" feature. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading.** Reason: LibreOffice may cause layout issues during server-side rendering due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore some special effects. LibreOffice is not required for uploading PDF files. Docker users who still need to support PPTX uploads within the container can run:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed via this method will be lost after container reconstruction and will need to be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run in the project root directory:
```bash
```

# macOS (Homebrew)

brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full

# Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9
```

# Then install Python dependencies

uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

#### Start Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important local data, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`
> Note: Under the default configuration, templates, assets, and final products are all stored in the `uploads/` folder.

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5011`.

Visit `http://localhost:5011/health` to verify that the service is running correctly.

#### Start Frontend Development Server
