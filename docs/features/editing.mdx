## Natural Language Editing

Instead of navigating complex menus, describe your changes in plain language:

- "Change the third page to a case study"
- "Replace this chart with a pie chart"
- "Make the background darker"
- "Add a summary bullet list"

## Outline Editing

In the Outline Editor, you can refine the structure by typing instructions like:

- "Add a section about competitive analysis after the introduction"
- "Merge the last two pages"
- "Move the conclusion before the Q&A page"

You can also manually drag and drop pages to reorder them, or edit chapter assignments.

## Region-Based Editing

In the Slide Preview, select a specific area of a slide and describe what you want changed. The AI will regenerate only that region while keeping the rest intact.
