## Formats

| Format | Editable | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| PPTX | Yes | Text, images, and layout are editable in PowerPoint |
| PDF | No | Pixel-perfect output, ready for presentation |

Both formats use 16:9 aspect ratio by default.

## Editable PPTX (Beta)

The editable PPTX export extracts text from generated slide images and recreates it as native PowerPoint text elements, preserving:

- Font size, color, and bold styling
- Text positioning
- Table content

<Note>
  For best results, configure `BAIDU_API_KEY` in your environment. See [Configuration](/configuration#baidu-api-key).
</Note>

## Page Selection

You can select specific pages to export rather than exporting the entire presentation. Use the multi-select feature in the Slide Preview to choose which pages to include.
