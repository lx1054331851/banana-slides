## How Materials Work

1. Upload files on the Home page or in the Detail Editor
2. The backend parses and extracts key content, images, and chart information
3. Extracted content is used as context when generating slide descriptions and images

## Image Pasting

You can paste images directly into the Home page, Outline Editor, or Description Cards. The system will recognize and incorporate them immediately.

## Style References

Upload reference images or templates to guide the visual style of your entire presentation. The AI will match the color scheme, layout patterns, and design language of your references.
