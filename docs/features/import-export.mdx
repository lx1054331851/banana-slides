description: "Markdown format for importing and exporting outlines and descriptions"
---

Banana Slides uses Markdown files (`.md` / `.txt`) to import and export outlines and page descriptions. The format is human-readable and easy to edit in any text editor.

## Format Structure

```markdown
# Project Title

> 生成时间: 2025/1/1 12:00:00

---

## 第 1 页: Cover Page

> 章节: Introduction

**大纲要点：**
- Company name and logo
- Presentation date

**页面描述：**
A clean cover page with the company logo centered, title in bold white text on a dark blue gradient background.

---

## 第 2 页: Market Overview

> 章节: Analysis

**大纲要点：**
- Industry growth trends
- Key market segments

**页面描述：**
A data-driven page showing a bar chart of market growth over the past 5 years, with key statistics highlighted in callout boxes.

```

## Field Reference

| Field | Syntax | Required |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Page header | `## 第 N 页: Title` | Yes |
| Chapter | `> 章节: Name` | No |
| Key points | `**大纲要点：**` followed by `- point` lines | No |
| Description | `**页面描述：**` followed by free text | No |

Pages are separated by `---`.

## Export Options

You can export from both the Outline Editor and Detail Editor:

| Source | Content |
|--------|---------|
| Outline Editor | Key points only (no descriptions) |
| Detail Editor | Both key points and descriptions |

## Import Behavior

- Imported pages are **appended** to the existing project — they do not replace current pages.
- Both `**大纲要点：**` and `**页面描述：**` markers are optional. If omitted, bullet lines (`- ...`) are treated as key points.
- HTML tags in imported content are automatically stripped.
- Accepts `.md` and `.txt` files.

## Minimal Example

A valid import file can be as simple as:

```markdown
## 第 1 页: Introduction
- Welcome and agenda
- Speaker introduction

## 第 2 页: Summary
- Key takeaways
```

## Generate with AI

Copy the prompt below into any AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.), replace the placeholders, and import the output directly into Banana Slides.

<Tip>
  For outline-only import, remove the `**页面描述：**` requirement from the prompt.

<Accordion title="AI Prompt Template">

```text
Generate a presentation outline in the following Markdown format.

Topic: [YOUR TOPIC]
Number of pages: [NUMBER, e.g. 8]
Language: [Chinese / English]
Style notes: [e.g. "professional and data-driven" or "playful and visual"]

Rules:
1. Each page starts with "## 第 N 页: Title"
2. Group pages into chapters using "> 章节: Chapter Name"
3. Under "**大纲要点：**", list 2-4 key points as "- point"
4. Under "**页面描述：**", write 1-2 sentences describing the visual layout,
   colors, charts, or imagery for that slide
5. Separate pages with "---"
6. First page should be a cover, last page should be a closing/thank-you page

Output ONLY the Markdown, no extra explanation.
