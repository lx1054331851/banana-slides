## From an Idea

The simplest way to get started. Enter a topic or sentence on the home page, and Banana Slides will:

1. Generate a structured outline with chapters
2. Create detailed page descriptions for each slide
3. Generate slide images based on the descriptions

## From an Outline

If you already have a structure in mind:

1. Create a project and go to the Outline Editor
2. Add, remove, or reorder pages and chapters
3. Use natural language to refine the outline (e.g., "add a section about market analysis")
4. Generate page descriptions from the outline

## From Page Descriptions

For maximum control, write detailed descriptions for each slide directly in the Detail Editor. Each description tells the AI exactly what content, layout, and style to render.

<Tip>
  Include specific text content in your descriptions for better text rendering quality on the generated slides.

## Style Customization

- **Reference images** — Upload style reference images to guide the visual style
- **Templates** — Use text-based style presets to control the look without images
- **Per-page materials** — Attach specific images or charts to individual slides
