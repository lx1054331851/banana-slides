## Creation Paths

Banana Slides supports three ways to start a presentation:

1. **From an idea** — Enter a topic, AI generates the full outline and page descriptions
2. **From an outline** — Provide your own structure, AI fills in the details
3. **From page descriptions** — Write detailed descriptions for each slide, AI generates the visuals

See [Creating Presentations](/features/creation) for details.

## Natural Language Editing

Modify any slide by describing what you want changed in plain language — no menus or buttons needed. Supports both full-page regeneration and region-specific edits.

See [Editing Slides](/features/editing) for details.

## Export

Export your presentation as PPTX (with editable text) or PDF in 16:9 format, ready for immediate use.
