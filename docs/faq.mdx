## Generated text is garbled or blurry

- Switch to a higher output resolution (2K recommended over 1K). Note: OpenAI format may not support higher resolutions — use Gemini format instead.
- Include the specific text content you want rendered in your page descriptions.

## Editable PPTX export has overlapping text or missing styles

This is usually an API configuration issue. Make sure `BAIDU_API_KEY` is set correctly. See [Configuration](/configuration#baidu-api-key) and [Issue #121](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121) for troubleshooting.

## Does the free Gemini API tier work?

The free tier supports text generation only. Image generation requires a paid tier.

## Getting 503 errors or Retry Errors

Check the backend logs for detailed error messages:

```bash
docker logs --tail 200 banana-slides-backend
```

This is typically caused by incorrect model configuration.

## Environment variable changes not taking effect

- If running via Docker, restart the container after editing `.env`.
- If you previously configured settings via the web UI Settings page, those values override `.env`. Use "Reset to Default" in Settings to revert.
